	Description:
	
	Project was written at C++ language. More of that it uses Bison and Flex tools. To be possible to run this project at device with UNIX system,
	you have to install proper libraries by commands:
		-	apt-get install g++;
		-	apt-get install bison;
		-	apt-get install flex.
	
	
	Main project is in the src/register_machine directory and contains:
		-	parser.y		- parser of a grammar. Uses Bison library. Creates a grammar based on input file.
		-	lexer.l			- lexer analyzer of a compiler. Uses Flex library.
		-	README			- this document.
		-	Instruction.hh		- file with tokens to analyze by grammar.
		-	mr.cc           	- file with methods to run a machine.
		-	mr-cln.cc           	- file with a machine specified for larger intigers.
		-	main.cc           	- main file. Simply runs a machine with specific input.
		-	Makefile
	
	
	To compile the project you should run command: "make". 
	After that commands from "Makefile" will start. Files like "parser.cc", "parser.hh", "compiler" etc. would be created.
	To run executable file "compiler", you should use a "./compiler [input] [output]" command, where:
		-	[input] 		- path to the input file;
		-	[output] 		- path to the file of output of machine code to register machine.
	
	An attempt of running another way will cause errors.
